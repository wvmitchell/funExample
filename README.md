# FunList!!

This application was built using `create-react-app`
After you clone this down
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
  - `npm test`

### Expectations / Rules

Build a React App that displays *fun events*!

You will have a 40 minutes to build this application. Whatever you don't finish in the mock assessment, we recommend you practice prior to the final assessment.

### Iteration 0

Walk through the mockup and outline the components that you will need to build this application.

Pull down the [API repo](https://github.com/rrgayhart/fun-parser) and get it up and running. Read over the README.

### Iteration 1

Create a controlled form component. 
As a user types into the input fields the components state should change. 

### Iteration 2

When the user clicks the submit button the application should make a post request to the API : https://github.com/rrgayhart/fun-parser.

***You may not have any fetch calls in any component other than App.***

### Iteration 3 

Once you have the API data display all events on the DOM.

### Iteration 4 (extension)

Pair with your evaluator to create a custom endpoint and hit it with your frontend

Example might be - adding a delete endpoint and then giving yourself to the ability to delete an event
